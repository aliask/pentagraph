Pentagraph is a browser-based app for performing PGP encryption and decryption.

Encryption keys are loaded into your browser, and are never sent anywhere. All encryption and decryption takes place locally, ensuring that your private data stays private.

Note that your browser will periodically clear its cache, and the keys will disappear so do not use it for long-term storage.
